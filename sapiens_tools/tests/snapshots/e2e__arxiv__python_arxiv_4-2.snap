- conclusion: "Title: Recommending Courses in MOOCs for Jobs: An Auto Weak Supervision Approach\nSummary: The proliferation of massive open online courses (MOOCs) demands an effective way of course recommendation for jobs posted in recruitment websites, especially for the people who take MOOCs to find new jobs. Despite the advances of supervised ranking models, the lack of enough supervised signals prevents us from directly learning a supervised ranking model. This paper proposes a general automated weak supervision framework AutoWeakS via reinforcement learning to solve the problem. On the one hand, the framework enables training multiple supervised ranking models upon the pseudo labels produced by multiple unsupervised ranking models. On the other hand, the framework enables automatically searching the optimal combination of these supervised and unsupervised models. Systematically, we evaluate the proposed model on several datasets of jobs from different recruitment websites and courses from a MOOCs platform. Experiments show that our model significantly outperforms the classical unsupervised, supervised and weak supervision baselines.\nPDF Url: \n\n\nTitle: Toward Compact Data from Big Data\nSummary: Bigdata is a dataset of which size is beyond the ability of handling a valuable raw material that can be refined and distilled into valuable specific insights. Compact data is a method that optimizes the big dataset that gives best assets without handling complex bigdata. The compact dataset contains the maximum knowledge patterns at fine grained level for effective and personalized utilization of bigdata systems without bigdata. The compact data method is a tailor-made design which depends on problem situations. Various compact data techniques have been demonstrated into various data-driven research area in the paper.\nPDF Url: \n\n\nTitle: How to define co-occurrence in different domains of study?\nSummary: This position paper presents a comparative study of co-occurrences. Some similarities and differences in the definition exist depending on the research domain (e.g. linguistics, NLP, computer science). This paper discusses these points, and deals with the methodological aspects in order to identify co-occurrences in a multidisciplinary paradigm.\nPDF Url: \n\n\nTitle: A SAT-based System for Consistent Query Answering\nSummary: An inconsistent database is a database that violates one or more integrity constraints, such as functional dependencies. Consistent Query Answering is a rigorous and principled approach to the semantics of queries posed against inconsistent databases. The consistent answers to a query on an inconsistent database is the intersection of the answers to the query on every repair, i.e., on every consistent database that differs from the given inconsistent one in a minimal way. Computing the consistent answers of a fixed conjunctive query on a given inconsistent database can be a coNP-hard problem, even though every fixed conjunctive query is efficiently computable on a given consistent database.\n  We designed, implemented, and evaluated CAvSAT, a SAT-based system for consistent query answering. CAvSAT leverages a set of natural reductions from the complement of consistent query answering to SAT and to Weighted MaxSAT. The system is capable of handling unions of conjunctive queries and arbitrary denial constraints, which include functional dependencies as a special case. We report results from experiments evaluating CAvSAT on both synthetic and real-world databases. These results provide evidence that a SAT-based approach can give rise to a comprehensive and scalable system for consistent query answering.\nPDF Url: "
