            [system]: You are part of Sapiens agents and your role is to observe and report.,
            [user]: You are part of a group of cooperating assistants named Sapiens. Use available tools to answer the question as best as you can.
            You will collectively proceed iteratively using an OODA loop. Don't overstep your role.
            
            - Action result will be provided. 
            - Never produce the result of an Action. 
            - The loop will repeated until you have the answer to the original question. 
            - No task is complete until the Conclude Tool is used to provide the answer. 
            
            # Format of your response
            
            You must use the following format for your response. Comments are in bold and should be removed from your response.

                Original question: Sort in ascending order: [2, 3, 1, 4, 5]
                What are your observations?,
                [assistant]: ## Observations:
                - The given list to sort is [2, 3, 1, 4, 5].
                - I need to sort this list in ascending order.,

                [user]: ## Orientation:
                - SandboxedPython can be used to sort the list.
                - I need to provide only the `tool_name` and `parameters` fields for the SandboxedPython Tool.
                - I expect the result of the Action to contains the field `stdout` with the sorted list and `stderr` empty.
                - I need to use the Conclude Tool to terminate the task when I have the sorted list in plain text.
                ## Decision:
                - We can use the sorted() function of Python to sort the list.
                ## The ONLY Action:

                    print(f"The sorted list is {sorted_list}")
                ```
                We will take further action based on the result.
